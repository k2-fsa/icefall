## Installation

Please refer to <https://icefall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html>
for installation.

## Recipes

Please refer to <https://icefall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/index.html>
for more information.

We provide two recipes at present:

  - [yesno][yesno]
  - [LibriSpeech][librispeech]

### yesno

This is the simplest ASR recipe in `icefall` and can be run on CPU.
Training takes less than 30 seconds and gives you the following WER:

```
[test_set] %WER 0.42% [1 / 240, 0 ins, 1 del, 0 sub ]
```
We do provide a Colab notebook for this recipe.

### LibriSpeech

We provide two models for this recipe: [conformer CTC model][LibriSpeech_conformer_ctc]
and [TDNN LSTM CTC model][LibriSpeech_tdnn_lstm_ctc].

#### Conformer CTC Model

The best WER we currently have is:

||test-clean|test-other|
|--|--|--|
|WER| 2.57% | 5.94% |

We provide a Colab notebook to run a pre-trained conformer CTC model: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1huyupXAcHsUrKaWfI83iMEJ6J0Nh0213?usp=sharing)

#### TDNN LSTM CTC Model

The WER for this model is:

||test-clean|test-other|
|--|--|--|
|WER| 6.59% | 17.69% |

We provide a Colab notebook to run a pre-trained TDNN LSTM CTC model:  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kNmDXNMwREi0rZGAOIAOJo93REBuOTcd?usp=sharing)
