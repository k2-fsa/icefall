## Installation

`icefall` depends on [k2][k2] for FSA operations and [lhotse][lhotse] for
data preparations. To use `icefall`, you have to install its dependencies first.
The following subsections describe how to setup the environment.

CAUTION: There are various ways to setup the environment. What we describe
here is just one alternative.

### Install k2

Please refer to [k2's installation documentation][k2-install] to install k2.
If you have any issues about installing k2, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/k2-fsa/k2/issues>.

### Install lhotse

Please refer to [lhotse's installation documentation][lhotse-install] to install
lhotse.

### Install icefall

`icefall` is a set of Python scripts. What you need to do is just to set
the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
cd $HOME/open-source
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall
cd icefall
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/open-source/icefall:$PYTHONPATHON
```

To verify `icefall` was installed successfully, you can run:

```bash
python3 -c "import icefall; print(icefall.__file__)"
```

It should print the path to `icefall`.
