Pruned transducer statelessX
============================

This tutorial shows you how to run a streaming conformer transducer model
with the `LibriSpeech <https://www.openslr.org/12>`_ dataset.


.. HINT::

  We assume you have read the page :ref:`install icefall` and have setup
  the environment for ``icefall``.

.. HINT::

  We recommend you to use a GPU or several GPUs to run this recipe.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

  - (1) How to prepare data for training and decoding
  - (2) How to start the training, either with a single GPU or multiple GPUs
  - (3) How to do decoding after training, with greedy_search modified_beam_search fast_beam_search
  - (4) How to use a pre-trained model, provided by us
  - (5) How to deploy your trained model with our server framework `Sherpa <https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa>`_.

Data preparation
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ ./prepare.sh

The script ``./prepare.sh`` handles the data preparation for you, **automagically**.
All you need to do is to run it.

The data preparation contains several stages, you can use the following two
options:

  - ``--stage``
  - ``--stop-stage``

to control which stage(s) should be run. By default, all stages are executed.


For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ ./prepare.sh --stage 0 --stop-stage 0

means to run only stage 0.

To run stage 2 to stage 5, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./prepare.sh --stage 2 --stop-stage 5

.. HINT::

  If you have pre-downloaded the `LibriSpeech <https://www.openslr.org/12>`_
  dataset and the `musan <http://www.openslr.org/17/>`_ dataset, say,
  they are saved in ``/tmp/LibriSpeech`` and ``/tmp/musan``, you can modify
  the ``dl_dir`` variable in ``./prepare.sh`` to point to ``/tmp`` so that
  ``./prepare.sh`` won't re-download them.

.. NOTE::

  All generated files by ``./prepare.sh``, e.g., features, lexicon, etc,
  are saved in ``./data`` directory.

We provide the following YouTube video showing how to run ``./prepare.sh``.
