TDNN-LSTM-CTC
=============

This tutorial shows you how to run a TDNN-LSTM-CTC model with the `LibriSpeech <https://www.openslr.org/12>`_ dataset.


.. HINT::

  We assume you have read the page :ref:`install icefall` and have setup
  the environment for ``icefall``.


Data preparation
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ ./prepare.sh

The script ``./prepare.sh`` handles the data preparation for you, **automagically**.
All you need to do is to run it.

The data preparation contains several stages, you can use the following two
options:

  - ``--stage``
  - ``--stop-stage``

to control which stage(s) should be run. By default, all stages are executed.


For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ ./prepare.sh --stage 0 --stop-stage 0

means to run only stage 0.

To run stage 2 to stage 5, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./prepare.sh --stage 2 --stop-stage 5


Training
--------

Now describing the training of TDNN-LSTM-CTC model, contained in
the `tdnn_lstm_ctc <https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/tree/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/tdnn_lstm_ctc>`_
folder.

The command to run the training part is:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3"
  $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py --world-size 4

By default, it will run ``20`` epochs. Training logs and checkpoints are saved
in ``tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp``.

In ``tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp``, you will find the following files:

  - ``epoch-0.pt``, ``epoch-1.pt``, ..., ``epoch-19.pt``

    These are checkpoint files, containing model ``state_dict`` and optimizer ``state_dict``.
    To resume training from some checkpoint, say ``epoch-10.pt``, you can use:

      .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py --start-epoch 11

  - ``tensorboard/``

    This folder contains TensorBoard logs. Training loss, validation loss, learning
    rate, etc, are recorded in these logs. You can visualize them by:

      .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp/tensorboard
        $ tensorboard dev upload --logdir . --description "TDNN LSTM training for librispeech with icefall"

  - ``log/log-train-xxxx``

    It is the detailed training log in text format, same as the one
    you saw printed to the console during training.


To see available training options, you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py --help

Other training options, e.g., learning rate, results dir, etc., are
pre-configured in the function ``get_params()``
in `tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py <https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py>`_.
Normally, you don't need to change them. You can change them by modifying the code, if
you want.

Decoding
--------

The decoding part uses checkpoints saved by the training part, so you have
to run the training part first.

The command for decoding is:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
  $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py

You will see the WER in the output log.

Decoded results are saved in ``tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py --help

shows you the available decoding options.

Some commonly used options are:

  - ``--epoch``

    You can select which checkpoint to be used for decoding.
    For instance, ``./tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py --epoch 10`` means to use
    ``./tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp/epoch-10.pt`` for decoding.

  - ``--avg``

    It's related to model averaging. It specifies number of checkpoints
    to be averaged. The averaged model is used for decoding.
    For example, the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py --epoch 10 --avg 3

    uses the average of ``epoch-8.pt``, ``epoch-9.pt`` and ``epoch-10.pt``
    for decoding.

  - ``--export``

    If it is ``True``, i.e., ``./tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py --export 1``, the code
    will save the averaged model to ``tdnn_lstm_ctc/exp/pretrained.pt``.
    See :ref:`tdnn_lstm_ctc use a pre-trained model` for how to use it.

.. HINT::

   There are several decoding methods provided in `tdnn_lstm_ctc/decode.py <https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/tdnn_lstm_ctc/train.py>`_, you can change the decoding method by modifying ``method`` parameter in function ``get_params()``.


.. _tdnn_lstm_ctc use a pre-trained model:

Pre-trained Model
-----------------

We have uploaded the pre-trained model to
`<https://huggingface.co/pkufool/icefall_asr_librispeech_tdnn-lstm_ctc>`_.

The following shows you how to use the pre-trained model.

Download the pre-trained model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ mkdir tmp
  $ cd tmp
  $ git lfs install
  $ git clone https://huggingface.co/pkufool/icefall_asr_librispeech_tdnn-lstm_ctc

.. CAUTION::

  You have to use ``git lfs`` to download the pre-trained model.

After downloading, you will have the following files:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd egs/librispeech/ASR
  $ tree tmp

.. code-block:: bash
