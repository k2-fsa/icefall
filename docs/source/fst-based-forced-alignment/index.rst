FST-based forced alignment
==========================

This section describes how to perform **FST-based** ``forced alignment`` with models
trained by `CTC`_ loss.

We use `CTC FORCED ALIGNMENT API TUTORIAL <https://pytorch.org/audio/main/tutorials/ctc_forced_alignment_api_tutorial.html>`_
from `torchaudio`_ as a reference in this section.

Different from `torchaudio`_, we use an ``FST``-based approach.
