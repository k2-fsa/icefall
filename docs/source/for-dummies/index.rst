Icefall for dummies tutorial
============================

This tutorial walks you step by step about how to create a simple
ASR (`Automatic Speech Recognition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition>`_)
system with `Next-gen Kaldi`_.

It uses the `yesno`_ dataset for demonstration. The `yesno`_ dataset
is very tiny and the model training can be finished within 20 seconds on ``CPU``.

That also means you don't need a ``GPU`` to finish this tutorial.

Let's get started!

Please follow items below **sequentially**.
