# Introduction

This is a public domain speech dataset consisting of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books. 
A transcription is provided for each clip. 
Clips vary in length from 1 to 10 seconds and have a total length of approximately 24 hours.

The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain. 
The audio was recorded in 2016-17 by the [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) project and is also in the public domain.
