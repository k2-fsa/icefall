# Introduction
KsponSpeech is a large-scale spontaneous speech corpus of Korean.
This corpus contains 969 hours of open-domain dialog utterances,
spoken by about 2,000 native Korean speakers in a clean environment.

All data were constructed by recording the dialogue of two people
freely conversing on a variety of topics and manually transcribing the utterances.

The transcription provides a dual transcription consisting of orthography and pronunciation,
and disfluency tags for spontaneity of speech, such as filler words, repeated words, and word fragments.

The original audio data has a pcm extension.
During preprocessing, it is converted into a file in the flac extension and saved anew.

KsponSpeech is publicly available on an open data hub site of the Korea government.
The dataset must be downloaded manually.

# Transducers
There are various folders containing the name `transducer` in this folder. The following table lists the differences among them.

|                                          | Encoder              | Decoder            | Comment                                           |

| `pruned_transducer_stateless7_streaming`                              | Streaming Zipformer   | Embedding + Conv1d | streaming version of pruned_transducer_stateless7                                 |

The decoder in `transducer_stateless` is modified from the paper [Rnn-Transducer with Stateless Prediction Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054419/). We place an additional Conv1d layer right after the input embedding layer.
