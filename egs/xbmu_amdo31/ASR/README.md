to build speech recognition systems,including transcribed texts and a Tibetan 
pronunciation lexicon.
(The lexicon is a Tibetan lexicon of the Lhasa dialect, which has been reused 
for the Amdo dialect because of the uniformity of the Tibetan language)
The dataset can be used to train a model for Amdo Tibetan Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). 

This recipe includes some different ASR models trained with XBMU-AMDO31.
