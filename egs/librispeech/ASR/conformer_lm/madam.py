class Madam(Optimizer):
    r"""Madam is a modification of the Adam algorithm, with various changes
    intended to support certain "common-sense" ideas and solve common
    pathologies that can happen particularly in transformer-type models that
    have multiplication of parameters (particularly, key and query matrices)--
    these can be vulnerable to "subspace loss" where, if you have any l2
    regularization, certain subspaces in the key/query space might get
    regularized towards zero.  We solve this with a special formula that
    changes how the l2/weight-decay is done (see compute_l2_grad()).
    I'll try to write the math down at some point.  This formula only
    applies to tensors that have at least two dimensions; for one-dimensional
    tensors we simply won't do l2 regularization.

    One more thing-- there is a special pathology that can sometimes afflict
    models like LSTMs, where a particular element of a minibatch experiences
    gradient blowup in the backward pass.  We'd like to identify such cases and
    fix it somehow, e.g. by removing or scaling down the gradient for that
    particular minibatch.  We can identify and somewhat fix this by seeing that the
    gradient norm (computed over all the parameters in a parameter group) is
    much more than on previous minibatches, and limiting it to (the preceding
    average step size times some constant).

    Like most optimization algorithms, for this to work well you need to
    have an appropriate learning rate schedule, either decreasing with
    time, or increasing (warm-up) and then decreasing.  The LR schedule may
    possibly need to decrease a little more aggressively than you would with
    Adam, or at least have smaller values overall than Adam, because
    the smaller parameters will mean the effective (relative) learning
    rate is higher.

    This is modified from PyTorch's optim/adam.py


    Args:
        params (iterable): iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining
            parameter groups
        lr (float, optional): learning rate (default: 1e-3)
        betas (Tuple[float, float], optional): coefficients used for computing
            running averages of gradient and its square (default: (0.9, 0.999))
        eps (float, optional): term added to the denominator to improve
            numerical stability (default: 1e-8)
        grad_norm_buffer_size (int, optional):  Buffer size used in detecting
            minibatches with unusually large gradients and scaling them down.
        limit_grad_factor (float): factor by which we don't allow the
            gradient to be greater than the average of previous gradients
            (we'll scale the gradient down, over the whole param-group,
            to enforce this).  Must be greater than 1.  Set to float('inf')
            to disable norm clipping.
        min_target_rms:  A floor on the "target rms" of each Tensor, so
            that Tensors that, when initialized, have less than this
            rms value will have their target rms value floored to this
        l2:  True to enable l2 regularization
        l2_period:  You may set this to a value greater than one to save
            computation by only periodically doing the l2 update.
            We include a scaling factor in the formula so that, as far
            as possible (for small learning rates) this shouldn't affect
            the results.  (Note: this probably isn't necessary to set,
            since it turns out the update is quite fast, at least on GPU,
            and the gradient clipping is actually more of a problem)

        Suppose the step of optimization is 's', i.e. with s = 0, 1, 2...
        We define 't = s / warm_step', i.e. t is the step s, normalized so that it
        is 1.0 at warm_step.  Our formula for the learning rate as a function of
        t is:
             rate = max_lrate * (t <= 1.0 ? t :
                                sqrt((2 + alpha) / (1 + t + alpha t^2)))
        where alpha is chosen so that the 't' and 'alpha t^2' terms are identical
        at t == knee_factor (this means alpha = 1.0/knee_factor).   So the
        learning rate increases linearly from t=00 to t=1, and decreases
        after that.  You can see
        that sqrt((2 + alpha) / (1 + t + alpha t^2))) is 1.0 when t == 1,
        which is why the line and the curve meet at that point.

        On the denominator  of that ratio, the "t" term makes it decrease a
        bit like 1/sqrt(t) in 1 <= t <= warm_step; the "alpha t^2" term
        makes it decrease a bit like 1/t for t > warm_step; and the "1"
        term makes it decrease a bit slower than 1/sqrt(t) when t is quite
        close to 1.0 (so we linger a little, near the maximum learning rate).

        This learning rate schedule ultimately decreases more aggressively
        than Noam, i.e. as 1 / t instead of 1 / sqrt(t).  The reason we
        feel this will work better in conjunction with Madam, is that Madam
        keeps the norms of the parameters approximately constant throughout
        training; whereas with Noam, if there is no weight decay, these
        norms tend to increase as training progresses (although rather
        unevenly across different parameter tensors).
        As the norms of the parameters increase, the relative changes
        in parameters get smaller (the step sizes don't change because
        Adam normalizes the gradient magnitudes; they'd get smaller otherwise).
        So Noam doesn't have to decrease the learning rate too aggressively
        because even with a fixed learning rate, the effective learning rate
        would be decreasing (again, this only applies without weight decay).

# Caution: this testing code is not very automated, it reqires looking at the output to
# make sure it looks right.  The main thing is that with l2=True, the printed stddevs stay close
# to the "Target rms" values, which are printed out; while with l2=False, the stddevs
# increase to significantly higher than that.
#
# The test of the Moam optimizer is mainly to make sure it runs; the scale of the
# gradients, and the learning rate, are such that one of the rms's stays quite a bit
# above the target value, i.e. (0.047, 0.044, 0.047), vs. targets of
# (0.057, 0.04, 0.019), I think this has to do with the alpha<1 stability mechanism being
# activated, the l2 does have an effect, as I verified by changing the code to set
# l2=False.
