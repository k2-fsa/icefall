    This context graph is a WFST as in
    `https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02480`
    or
    `https://wenet.org.cn/wenet/context.html`.
    It is simple, as it does not have the capability to detect
    word boundaries. So, if a biasing word (e.g., 'us', the country)
    happens to be the prefix of another word (e.g., 'useful'),
    the word 'useful' will be mistakenly boosted. This is not desired.
    However, this context graph is easy to understand.

        A list (batch) of lists. Each sub-list contains the context for
        the utterance. The sub-list again is a list of lists. Each sub-sub-list
        is the token sequence of a word.
      backoff_id:
        The id of the backoff token. It serves for failure arcs.

        The bonus for each token during decoding, which will hopefully
        boost the token up to survive beam search.
