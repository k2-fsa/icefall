### LibriSpeech BPE training results (Conformer-CTC)
#### 2021-08-19
(Wei Kang): Result of https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/pull/13

TensorBoard log is available at https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/GnRzq8WWQW62dK4bklXBTg/#scalars

Pretrained model is available at https://huggingface.co/pkufool/icefall_asr_librispeech_conformer_ctc

The best decoding results (WER) are listed below, we got this results by averaging models from epoch 15 to 34, and using `attention-decoder` decoder with num_paths equals to 100.

||test-clean|test-other|
|--|--|--|
|WER| 2.57% | 5.94% |

To get more unique paths, we scaled the lattice.scores with 0.5 (see https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/pull/10#discussion_r690951662 for more details), we searched the lm_score_scale and attention_score_scale for best results, the scales that produced the WER above are also listed below.

||lm_scale|attention_scale|
|--|--|--|
|test-clean|1.3|1.2|
|test-other|1.2|1.1|

You can use the following commands to reproduce our results:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall
cd icefall

# It was using ef233486, you may not need to switch to it
# git checkout ef233486

cd egs/librispeech/ASR
./prepare.sh

                               --max-duration 20 \
                               --num-paths 100

### LibriSpeech training results (Tdnn-Lstm)
#### 2021-08-24

(Wei Kang): Result of phone based Tdnn-Lstm model.

Icefall version: https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/commit/caa0b9e9425af27e0c6211048acb55a76ed5d315

Pretrained model is available at https://huggingface.co/pkufool/icefall_asr_librispeech_tdnn-lstm_ctc

The best decoding results (WER) are listed below, we got this results by averaging models from epoch 19 to 14, and using `whole-lattice-rescoring` decoding method.

||test-clean|test-other|
|--|--|--|
|WER| 6.59% | 17.69% |

We searched the lm_score_scale for best results, the scales that produced the WER above are also listed below.

||lm_scale|
|--|--|
|test-clean|0.8|
|test-other|0.9|
