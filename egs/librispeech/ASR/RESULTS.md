TensorBoard log is available at https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/GnRzq8WWQW62dK4bklXBTg/#scalars

Pretrained model is available at https://huggingface.co/pkufool/conformer_ctc

The best decoding results (WER) are listed below, we got this results by averaging models from epoch 15 to 34, and using `attention-decoder` decoder with num_paths equals to 100.

||test-clean|test-other|
|--|--|--|
|WER| 2.57% | 5.94% |

To get more unique paths, we scaled the lattice.scores with 0.5 (see https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/pull/10#discussion_r690951662 for more details), we searched the lm_score_scale and attention_score_scale for best results, the scales that produced the WER above are also listed below.

||lm_scale|attention_scale|
|--|--|--|
|test-clean|1.3|1.2|
|test-other|1.2|1.1|
