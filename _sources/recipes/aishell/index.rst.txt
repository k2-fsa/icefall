Aishell is an open-source Chinese Mandarin speech corpus published by Beijing
Shell Shell Technology Co.,Ltd.

400 people from different accent areas in China are invited to participate in
the recording, which is conducted in a quiet indoor environment using high
fidelity microphone and downsampled to 16kHz. The manual transcription accuracy
is above 95%, through professional speech annotation and strict quality
inspection. The data is free for academic use. We hope to provide moderate
amount of data for new researchers in the field of speech recognition.
